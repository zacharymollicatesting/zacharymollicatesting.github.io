The band was formed in 2016 and has played many concerts in the Halifax region (especially at The Company House, Spatz Theatre, and The Halifax Distilling Company), the Valley and along the South Shore. So far, all of their independent ticketed concerts have sold out. These seasoned musicians bring a wealth of international experience and sophistication to their music. Singly they have performed all over the world under the big band, jazz, musical theatre, world music, country, folk and classical umbrellas. The sultry and emotive vocals of Irene Wilkinson joined by her illustrious musical partner, guitarist Georges Herbert, and the trio is completed by bassist Tom Easley. This evening at Cecilia’s Retreat is sure to fill up the senses!</p> <p><strong>About the artists</strong></p> <p><em>Irene Wilkinson</em></p> <p>Although her formal qualifications are in biomedical science (cancer research), vocalist Irene Wilkinson has worked, for much of her life, in fine and performing arts, as a graphic artist, musician, singer, songwriter, radio producer with CBC, dance teacher, artistic and technical director, scriptwriter &amp; choreographer, motivational speaker and in educational support for children at risk (she continues her work as a writer/presenter in this field and the results of her research are published in various educational journals). Irene travelled extensively throughout her native England and in Europe as part of the band “Hermanas” with her sister, Carole. Tours of France, Spain, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Italy, Sardinia and Sicily led to the release of a record which made the top seller list in Sicily. Soon after her marriage in 1974, she followed her husband, Peter, to Nova Scotia where she became involved with the theatre and eventually applied her talents to radio variety with CBC. She recorded and produced programs for the national network and introduced Canadian audiences to current popular music from other countries (“Pop Over the World”) exposing an underground and thriving jazz movement, in what was then the U.S.S.R., by means of a two-part documentary heard across the network on Jazz Radio Canada. She also produced records for Nova Scotian artists like McGinty, Sandy Greenberg and Cobblestone, made many personal radio and television appearances on programs about women and music in Nova Scotia including recordings for airplay (“Music Maritimes”). Irene taught dance and has choreographed and directed more than 50 musicals in the Halifax school system including a full-scale production of Engelbert Humperdink’s opera “Hansel and Gretel in1994, featuring the Halifax All Schools Honour Choirs. She worked with music teachers to develop ‘riser’ choreography for school choirs such as Soundtrax, a popular Halifax high school vocal ensemble. In addition to organizing benefit concerts for charity, doing publicity for 4 choirs in the city and volunteering, she is also something of an activist, passionate about human rights and supportive of many movements including anti-poverty, anti-racism, equality and inclusion. Two of her greatest passions are reviving the great standards from the “Golden Era of Song” in the 20s, 30s and 40s … and singing jazz.</p> <p><em>Georges Hebert</em></p> <p>Guitarist, sound engineer and producer, Georges Hebert, began playing guitar in the early 60s, influenced by Chet Atkins, Django Reinhardt, Barney Kessel and Charlie Byrd amongst others.
