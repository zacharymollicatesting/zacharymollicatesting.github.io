--- Proteus Saxophone Quartet

Musique Royale is delighted to welcome the musicians of Proteus, an ensemble uniting four saxophonists from across Canada to St. John's Anglican Church in Lunenburg.  Originally formed in Paris in 2011, the members united through their combined curiosity and love for exploring chamber music specifically written for the saxophone quartet. Come hear this saxohone quartet perform repertoire of Grieg and Bach, along with works by current composers including Daniel Bellefeuille, Thierry Escaich, and Paul Suchan!

A high-energy modular ensemble, Proteus Quartet collaborates with contemporary artists on new works exploring the capabilities of the saxophone quartet and its various instrumental combinations. Progressing from a foundation based on the exploration of traditional works, transcriptions and new music, they have built a unique personal catalog stimulated by projects, relationships and encounters with composers, artists and guest performers. With a strong presence across Canada, they strive to share their music with audiences and communities through performances, masterclasses and workshops with students and the public.
